= Eventuate Tram Sagas Customers and Orders

This application  demonstrates how to maintain data consistency in an Java/JDBC/JPA-based  microservice architecture using http://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html[sagas].

The application consists of two services:

* `Order Service` - creates orders
* `Customer Service` - manages customers

Both services are implemented using Spring Boot, JPA and the https://github.com/eventuate-tram/eventuate-tram-sagas[Eventuate Tram Saga framework]

The `Order Service` uses a saga to enforce the customer's credit limit when creating orders.
